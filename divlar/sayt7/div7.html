            <p class="text"><br>No contemporary car collection would be complete without a supercar. And since the first
                supercar, Lamborghini's Miura, was produced, plenty of brands have popped up to serve the ultra-luxury
                segment. As a guide, we've compiled a list of the best supercar brands in the world.Established in 2008,
                Arrinera is known for creating the first supercar designed and engineered in Poland. Founders and
                brothers Lukasz and Marek Tomkiewicz announced its first proof-of-concept supercar in 2011.
                This led to their second prototype, the Hussarya, a racing car powered by a General Motors LS7 V8 engine. With a top
                speed of 350 km/h, it can accelerate to 100km/h in 3.2 seconds.Though the British car manufacturer was
                founded by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford in 1913, it was only after David Brown bought the company in
                1947 that the brand became synonymous to supercars. From the DB1 to the DB11, Aston Martin has produced
                several supercars, which have become icons in their own right.
                This French car manufacturer is known for offering high-performance automobiles. Ettore Bugatti founded
                the company in Molsheim, a commune in Alsace, in 1909 with the motto: "Nothing is too expensive, nothing
                is too beautiful." While the manufacturer's notable models include the Type 35 Grand Prix cars, Type 41
                "Royale," and the Type 57 "Atlantic," more contemporary models such as the Veyron and Chiron have gained
                a lot of attention in recent years.
