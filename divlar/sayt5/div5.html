            <p class="text"><br>THE BUGATTI VEYRON and Chiron already both rank in the top ten fastest cars, ever. But
                in the never-ending arms race for the extreme, Bugatti thinks it can one-up itself. Today, in front of
                the super sophisticated audience that the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance tends to attract, company
                bosses pulled back an electric blue sheet to reveal the Bugatti Divo. (Cue gentle applause from the
                well-dressed crowd.)

                Bugatti has found its automotive niche—building road-going hypercars—and the Divo pushes the definition
                as far as possible by iterating on the Chiron. The sheet gradually revealed mat grey bodywork
                underneath, rippling with sharp angles and gaping inlets. In your rear-view mirror, this thing would
                look like an angry shark.

                “For us, the design has to be recognizable as a real Bugatti,” says Stephan Winkelmann, president of the
                brand. That means there’s a giant horseshoe shaped grille, a center line that runs over the hood and the
                roof of the car, and scoop-shaped signature lines on the doors. “These are the three keys elements that
                certify a Bugatti, even if you don’t see the logo,” he says.

                The huge inlets mean engineers have been able to improve cooling and increase downforce by 198 pounds
                over the Chiron, with the help of a 23 percent larger rear wing. The car is also 77 pounds lighter.
                Bugatti didn’t reveal a 0 to 60, but top speed is 236 mph, and it says the car can handle the Nardò
                track in southern Italy a full eight seconds faster than the Chiron.

                Propulsion comes from an eight-liter, W16 engine, which makes 1,500 horsepower. (No nods to our electric
                future here.) Drivers will only be able to make use of all that on a track, where the car would look
                perfectly at home, with a blue stripe highlighting the front splitter and sills. The stripe motif is
                also carried into the interior, with bright blue accents on the racing seats and steering wheel.
